# ⚡ **Dcryptor** ⚡

## 🏁 Overview

Dcryptor is an android app using OCR tech to recognise text, more precisely, crypted-text and then sends the data to a server to decrypt it recursively.

The application consists of a Frontend made on JAVA, and a Backend made using NodeJS and Python. The app captures the encrypted text in an image, recognizes its encryption algorithm, and sends it to the NodeJS backend to decrypt. The backend in turn, decrypts it, and sends back the result to the user to __*see, save, and share!*__

## 🎆 Major Features

* Uses Optical Character Recognition.
* Automatic Encryption Detection. (Detects the kind of encryption technique used)
* Decyrpts data recursively.
* Saves previously decrypted data.
* Ability to share the results with friends.

## ⚙️ Usage

The app has an easy to use, Flat-UI. It recognizes and converts the text in the image(preferably crypted), using one of the best, Google's own Optical Character Recognition libraries, and passes it to highly efficient decrypting algorithms to show the hidden meaning behind the encrypted text.The application does not only show the final decrypted text, it also shows the text after each round of decryption, in case anyone misses something.

__*You can also access your previously decrypted results and share them too!*__
